# Hill_Cipher:

* Cipher.py is just for Encryption and Decryption.
* Hill_Cipher.py is for decrypting unknown cipher text when you have a known cipher text and the plain text it coresponds to. (Using Trigram Attack)(Plain Text Attack)

# Prgram Question:

Decrypt the two Hill ciphers, one using 4x4 key, and another using 3x3 key using a probable trigram attack. You should make use of the matrix inversion programs to check the probable trigrams. You may also want to develop some simple statistical checkers to reduce your load in determining whether trial decryptions are correct or not.
